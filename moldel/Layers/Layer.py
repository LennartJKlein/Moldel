        Parameters:
            predict_season (int): The season number for which the likelihood distribution is computed (the season
                started at 19 november 1999 is considered as season number 1).
            latest_episode (int): From the predict_season we only use episode data from episodes with numbers until the
                latest_episode number as observation data. This also includes the entire episode data from the episode
                with the latest_episode number. <br>
                - Set this value to sys.maxsize if you want to use all episodes from the predict_season as observation
                    data.
                - Set this value to 0 if you want to use no episodes from the predict_season as observation data.
                    (Which can be used to check the performance of only the pre-layers)
            train_seasons (set[int]): A set of season numbers (int) which are used for training this layer.

        Returns:
            Dict[Player, float]: A dictionary that contains the likelihood for each player that it is the 'Mol'. The key
                of this dictionary is the Player for which the likelihood is computed and the value is a float which
                indicates how likely the player is the 'Mol'.
